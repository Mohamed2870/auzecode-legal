    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>AuzeCS operates the <b>PrepCoach</b> mobile app (the “App”). Contact: <a href="mailto:auzecode@outlook.com">auzecode@outlook.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Account data (on device)</b>: email, display name, a local profile ID. Passwords are salted+hashed and stored in the iOS Keychain (we never store plaintext).</li>
      <li><b>Interview content</b>: questions/answers, transcripts, and summaries saved <b>on your device</b> (UserDefaults) so you can review sessions.</li>
      <li><b>Voice</b>: if you use the mic, audio is recorded on device and may be sent to our server solely to transcribe your answer.</li>
      <li><b>Purchases</b>: Apple processes payments (StoreKit). We receive product IDs and success state to update your credit balance; we do not receive your card details.</li>
      <li><b>Optional switches</b>: “Share analytics” and “Allow tracking” are user-controlled. If off, we do not send this data. The App functions without tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Run mock interviews, generate feedback, and maintain your credit balance.</li>
      <li>Transcribe voice answers when you choose to use the mic.</li>
      <li>Operate, secure, and improve the App; prevent abuse; provide support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Processing & storage</h2>
    <p><b>On-device:</b> accounts, history, and saved transcripts live on your device until you delete them or remove the App. “Delete Account” in Settings removes your local profile, interview history, and Keychain credential for that profile.</p>
    <p><b>Our server:</b> when you use voice or request AI features, your audio/text may be relayed through our server (hosted on Cloudflare Workers) to our AI provider to return questions and feedback. We use HTTPS and may use certificate pinning. Audio sent for transcription is deleted after processing; minimal logs may be retained briefly for security and abuse monitoring.</p>
    <p><b>AI provider (OpenAI API):</b> prompts/answers needed to generate questions and feedback are processed by OpenAI. OpenAI’s handling and retention of API data are governed by their policies; see their documentation for current details. We do not permit use of your API data for model training to the extent our account settings allow.</p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We share only with service providers as needed to operate the App (e.g., Apple for payments, Cloudflare for hosting, OpenAI for AI processing). These providers process data under our instructions.</p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>iOS Settings → Microphone to revoke mic access.</li>
      <li>In-App Settings → toggle analytics/tracking (off by default).</li>
      <li>In-App Settings → Delete Account to remove local profile and history.</li>
      <li>Email us to request deletion of any server-side remnants: <a href="mailto:auzecode@outlook.com">auzecode@outlook.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object or restrict certain processing. We do not “sell” or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. Contact us to exercise rights.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU/UK). Do not use the App if you are under the minimum age.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (HTTPS, Keychain for credentials). No method is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Providers may process data globally. By using the App you consent to these transfers as allowed by law.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. We will update the “Effective” date and, when appropriate, notify you in-app.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Email <a href="mailto:auzecode@outlook.com">auzecode@outlook.com</a> for privacy questions or requests.</p>
